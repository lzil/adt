			<p>Auditions for the Spring 2013 season will be 3-5:30pm this Saturday, February 16th, in the McCormick Dance Studio! We will be teaching a short technique lesson followed by some traditional and hip-hop choreography, and view previews of this semester's pieces. Remember to wear comfortable clothing!</p>

			<p>No dance experience is required; we accept all those who audition, regardless of experience, race, age, and gender.</p>

			<h1 class="topic-header push-down">Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
			<p>If you have a question that is not answered here, send an e-mail to adt-exec@mit.edu.</p>

			<p><span class="question">Q: How many people do you accept? What if I have no dance experience?</span><br />
			Anyone who auditions for MITADT will automatically be accepted regardless of experience, race, age, or gender. We believe in giving equal opportunity to experience the amazing culture of East Asian dance. Auditions are for the reference of the choreographers so that we may place you into the appropriate dances that fit your skill level, and you'll have the opportunity to select dances you're interested in.</p>

			<p><span class="question">Q: What should I expect at auditions?</span><br />
			Auditions are two-part. The first focuses on technical ability - all members will be led through a series of technique-building drills as the choreographers and captains assess raw ability. The second focuses on artistry - the captains will teach a 1-minute simple dance sequence, and auditionees will be asked to perform the sequence in groups of 4-5. After you audition, the choreographers will show you the pieces we're learning this semester and you will get to choose which ones you want to do.</p>

			<p><span class="question">Q: What should I bring to audition?</span><br />
			Please wear comfortable clothing that is not too baggy, in addition to either ballet shoes or socks. Going barefoot is fine but not advised; jazz shoes and anything else is not permitted. You may want to bring a water bottle or something to drink, since auditions will probably take 2+ hours. Other than that, you should not need to bring anything else.</p>

			<p><span class="question">Q: Will everyone get the dances they want?</span><br /> 
			Unfortunately, due to the difficulty of some of the dances and rehearsal scheduling, not everyone will be able to get the dance(s) they put down on their preference form at the audition session. However, the exec.team is willing to devote as much time as possible to making sure everyone gets into at least one of the dances they put down on their form =)</p>

			<p><span class="question">Q: What if I can't make auditions?</span><br />
			Send an e-mail to adt-exec@mit.edu and describe the reason for your absence. The executive board will schedule a make-up audition for you at earliest convenience. Thanks!<p>
