		<p>Spring 2015 Auditions will be held on Saturday, February 7 from 2-5:30PM in the <a href="http://whereis.mit.edu/?go=W4">McCormick Dance Studio</a>.</p>
                <p>At auditions, you will learn some traditional and hip-hop choreography, as well as preview this semester's pieces. Please wear comfortable clothing that you can move in.</p>

                <p>Don't worry if you don't have any dance experience! Many of our members join without prior dance experience. We accept all those who audition, regardless of experience, race, age, gender, etc. (Note: You do not have to be a first-year, or even an undergraduate, to audition. We welcome everyone and would love to have you!) </p>
                <p>If you have any questions or cannot make the audition date, please contact the ADT Exceutive Board by emailing <a href="mailto:adt-exec@mit.edu">adt-exec@mit.edu</a>.</p>
                <p><b>If you have a conflict with the audition time, please contact us <i>before</i> the day of auditions to schedule a make-up!</b>

                        <h1 class="topic-header push-down">Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
                        
                        <p>If you have a question that is not answered here, send an e-mail to adt-exec@mit.edu.</p>
                        
                        <p><span class="question">Q: How many people do you accept? What if I have no dance experience?</span><br />
                        Anyone who auditions for MITADT will automatically be accepted regardless of experience, race, age, or gender. We believe in giving equal opportunity to experience the amazing culture of East Asian dance. Auditions are for the reference of the choreographers so that we may place you into the appropriate dances that fit your skill level, and you'll have the opportunity to select dances you're interested in.</p>
                        
                        <p><span class="question">Q: What should I expect at auditions?</span><br />
                        Auditions are two-part. The first focuses on technical ability--all members will be led through a technique-building drill as the choreographers and captains assess raw ability. The second focuses on artistry--the captains will teach a minute-long simple dance sequence, and auditionees will be asked to perform the sequence in groups. After you audition, the choreographers will show you the pieces we're learning this semester and you will get to choose which ones you want to do.</p>
                        
                        <p><span class="question">Q: What should I bring to audition?</span><br />
                        Please wear comfortable clothing that is not too baggy, in addition to either ballet shoes or socks. Going barefoot is fine but not advised. You may want to bring a water bottle or something to drink. Other than that, you should not need to bring anything else.</p>
                        
                        <p><span class="question">Q: Will everyone get the dances they want?</span><br /> Unfortunately, due to the difficulty of some of the dances and rehearsal scheduling, not everyone will be able to get the dance(s) they put down on their preference form at the audition session. However, the exec team is willing to devote as much time as possible to making sure everyone gets into at least one of the dances they put down on their form.</p>
                        
                        <p><span class="question">Q: What if I can't make auditions?</span><br />
                        Send an e-mail to adt-exec@mit.edu <b>before the date of auditions</b> and describe the reason for your absence. The executive board will schedule a make-up audition for you at earliest convenience. Thanks!<p>
