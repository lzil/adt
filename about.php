		<h1 class="topic-header">General</h1>
		<p>The MIT Asian Dance Team (MIT ADT) is a student organization focused on the many diverse forms of East Asian dance, from traditional Chinese, aboriginal folk, and contemporary lyrical to Korean hip-hop and Japanese idol dance.</p>
		<p>Founded in Fall 2009 by Vivian Lee '12, MIT ADT is made up of over 150 MIT undergraduate and graduate students, in addition to other MIT affiliates, who come from a wide spectrum of cultural backgrounds.  Though some members have had dance training, the majority of us joined with little to no past dance experience, solely with the desire to learn about East Asian dance.</p>

		<h1 class="topic-header">Showcases & Performances</h1>
		<p>MIT ADT hosts two showcases per year, one at the end of each semester. Both the fall and spring showcases are open to MIT and Greater Boston communities, as well as to the general public. Our showcases feature pieces by MIT ADT as well as guest appearances by other MIT student groups (i.e. Syncopasian, Lion Dance), artistic groups from around Boston (i.e. Dance Revelasian), and similar collegiate dance groups from Harvard, Boston University, and Wellesley.</p>
		<p>In addition to our semesterly showcases, members also perform at many on- and off-campus events, such as fundraisers and Chinese New Year celebrations. To learn more about these performances, please visit our Performances pages.</p>

		<h1 class="topic-header">Being on the Team</h1>
		<p>Each semester, members attend rehearsals for pieces in preparation for the end-of-term showcase. Members are given the freedom to choose how many pieces, as well as which pieces, to be part of, and attend weekly practices for each of their dances. While many of our pieces are adapted from award-winning pieces in China's dance competitions or choreography from renowned Asian hip-hop groups, many others are composed of original choreography by our own members.</p>
		<p>We also host several social events throughout the semester. Though we are focused primarily on East Asian dance, MIT ADT is also a great way to get to know other people and have some fun!</p>
