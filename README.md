This is a public repo for the source code of the MIT Asian Dance Team (MIT ADT) website. It's more or less all pretty self-explanatory; as a one-pager, all the front-facing HTML is in one file (index.html).  

The website is live at adt.mit.edu - I redesigned it from the old look, which is at adt.mit.edu/old_site. The newer (current) version runs purely HTML/CSS and frontend Javascript; the contact form on the old site was removed in favor of links that have you simply email adt-exec@mit.edu.
