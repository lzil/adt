This is a public repo for the source code of the MIT Asian Dance Team (MIT ADT) website. It's more or less all pretty self-explanatory; as a one-pager, all the front-facing HTML is divided between several files, centered on `index.html`.  

The website is live at [adt.mit.edu](adt.mit.edu) - I redesigned it from the old look, which is at [adt.mit.edu/old_site](adt.mit.edu/old_site). The newer (current) version runs purely HTML/CSS and frontend Javascript; the contact form on the old site was removed in favor of links that have you simply email us at [adt-exec@mit.edu](mailto:adt-exec@mit.edu).
